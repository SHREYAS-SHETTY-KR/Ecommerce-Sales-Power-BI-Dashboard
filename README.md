## Project Overview

This project is focused on the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to efficiently monitor and analyze online sales data. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key sales metrics and performance benchmarks. It incorporates complex parameters that empower users to explore specific subsets of data within the dashboard. Customization options, such as filters and slicers, are seamlessly integrated, enabling users to tailor their analytical approach according to their requirements.

The project involves the establishment of connections, integration of new tables, and execution of data computations to refine and enhance the dataset. This foundational work sets the stage for user-centric parameters that guide visualizations, resulting in a more dynamic and personalized analytical experience. A variety of tailored visualizations have been utilized, including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, area charts, maps, and slicers. These visualizations effectively present sales data in a coherent and visually compelling manner.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive solution for online sales analysis through an intuitive and interactive Power BI dashboard.
